## Case Title
Beer Game: Interactive Supply Chain Management Simulation Platform

## Background
The Beer Game is a renowned educational simulation developed at MIT Sloan School of Management in the 1960s by Jay Forrester to teach supply chain management principles. Despite being over 60 years old, it remains one of the most effective tools for demonstrating the bullwhip effect, inventory management challenges, and the importance of information sharing in supply chains. Currently, most digital implementations are either proprietary, expensive for educational institutions, or lack modern features like AI-assisted learning and comprehensive analytics. There is a need for an accessible, feature-rich web platform that can serve both individual learners and educational institutions while leveraging modern AI capabilities to enhance the learning experience.

## Purpose
This application aims to create a comprehensive, AI-enhanced web-based Beer Game platform that serves two primary purposes: (1) providing an engaging single-player and multiplayer simulation experience for individuals to learn supply chain management concepts through hands-on practice, and (2) offering educators a complete classroom management system with automated student allocation, progress tracking, AI-generated assessments, and detailed analytics. The application will make supply chain education more accessible, interactive, and measurable while demonstrating how AI can enhance both learning outcomes and teaching efficiency.

## Target Users

**Primary Users:**
1. Students learning supply chain management, operations management, or business administration
2. Supply chain professionals seeking training and skill development
3. Individual learners interested in understanding supply chain dynamics

**Secondary Users:**
1. Educators teaching operations or supply chain management courses
2. Training coordinators in corporate environments
3. Researchers studying supply chain behavior and decision-making patterns

### BMAD-Methodology Alignment

**Phase 1 (Analyze)**: Deep understanding of business problem, user needs, and constraints
**Phase 2 (Planning)**: Strategic planning of solution approach with clear milestones
**Phase 3 (Architecture & Design)**: Complete technical and visual blueprint before coding
**Phase 4 (Development)**: Rapid AI-assisted implementation following the blueprint

**Key Success Factors**:
- Clear separation of design and development phases prevents rework
- Comprehensive architecture in Phase 3 enables confident AI-assisted coding in Phase 4
- Week 44 planning prevents scope creep
- Weeks 45-46 design work provides clear implementation roadmap
- AI-assisted development in Phase 4 accelerates coding by 40-50%
- Daily standups in Phase 4 ensure rapid issue resolution

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Phase 3 architecture reviews catch issues before development
- Two-week development sprint focuses team on MVP features
- Testing integrated into Week 48 prevents last-minute surprises
- Day 6 deployment prep allows Day 7 low-stress launch

## Development Approach

**AI-Assisted Development Strategy**:
- Use Claude Code or GitHub Copilot for component boilerplate and standard patterns
- AI assists with TypeScript type definitions and API endpoint generation
- Human oversight for business logic, AI prompts, and architecture decisions
- Pair programming approach: AI generates, developer reviews and refines

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit tests for game logic (cost calculations, state transitions)
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows (game completion, payment)
- Manual testing for AI-generated content quality

**Version Control**:
- Git with feature branch workflow
- Main branch protected with required reviews
- Semantic versioning for releases

## Risk Assessment

**Technical Risks**:
- **AI API Costs**: OpenAI API usage could exceed budget with many concurrent users
  - *Mitigation*: Implement caching, rate limiting, and usage monitoring; design fallback rule-based AI
- **Real-time Performance**: WebSocket connections might not scale well
  - *Mitigation*: Start with polling for MVP, add WebSockets incrementally; use managed services like Pusher if needed
- **Database Performance**: Game_rounds table could grow very large
  - *Mitigation*: Implement pagination, archival strategy, and database indexing from the start

**Project Risks**:
- **Scope Creep**: Feature-rich proposal might exceed 6-week timeline
  - *Mitigation*: Clear MVP definition, prioritized feature list, willingness to defer nice-to-have features
- **AI Integration Complexity**: OpenAI prompts might not produce consistent results
  - *Mitigation*: Extensive prompt testing early (week 2), fallback to simpler rule-based logic if needed
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe integration and webhook handling can be complex
  - *Mitigation*: Use Stripe's official SDKs and follow documentation closely; allocate dedicated time in week 5

**User Adoption Risks**:
- **Teacher Onboarding**: Teachers might find platform too complex
  - *Mitigation*: Create clear onboarding flow, video tutorials, and responsive support
- **Student Engagement**: Game might not be engaging enough
  - *Mitigation*: Iterative UI/UX testing, gamification elements, clear learning outcomes

**Assumptions**:
- AI-assisted development will increase productivity by 40-50% for routine coding tasks
- PostgreSQL + Prisma provides sufficient performance for expected user load (100 concurrent users)
- OpenAI API will maintain consistent availability and performance
- Stripe handles payment security and compliance, reducing development burden
- Modern web browsers support all required features (WebSockets, local storage, modern JavaScript)
- Teachers are willing to pay $19-99/month for classroom management features
- 6 weeks is sufficient for a feature-complete MVP given AI assistance and focused scope
