# Validation Report

**Document:** c:\IBE160\projects\beergame\docs\prd.md
**Checklist:** C:\IBE160\projects\beergame\bmad\bmm\workflows\2-plan-workflows\prd\checklist.md
**Date:** 2025-11-10T14:00:00Z

## Summary
- **Overall:** 0/85 passed (0%)
- **Critical Issues:** 1

## Critical Failures (Auto-Fail)

If ANY of these are true, validation FAILS:

- [X] ❌ **No epics.md file exists** (two-file output required)
- [ ] ❌ **Epic 1 doesn't establish foundation** (violates core sequencing principle)
- [ ] ❌ **Stories have forward dependencies** (breaks sequential implementation)
- [ ] ❌ **Stories not vertically sliced** (horizontal layers block value delivery)
- [ ] ❌ **Epics don't cover all FRs** (orphaned requirements)
- [ ] ❌ **FRs contain technical implementation details** (should be in architecture)
- [ ] ❌ **No FR traceability to stories** (can't validate coverage)
- [ ] ❌ **Template variables unfilled** (incomplete document)

## Recommendations
1.  **Must Fix:** The `epics.md` file must be created in the `C:\IBE160\projects\beergame\docs\` directory. This file is essential for breaking down the Product Requirements into actionable epics and stories. Without it, there is no way to validate the completeness of the project plan.
