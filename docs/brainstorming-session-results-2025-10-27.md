# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-10-27
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** BIP

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** User Flow Deviations & Edge Cases

**Session Goals:** To identify potential deviations, edge cases, and alternative paths that users might take, which are not covered in the primary "happy path" flows of the Beer Game proposal. The aim is to ensure the final application is robust and handles unexpected user behavior gracefully.

**Techniques Used:** 
- Chaos Engineering
- Role Playing

**Total Ideas Generated:** 4

### Key Themes Identified:

- **Input Validation:** The need for strict server-side validation and sanitization on all user inputs.
- **State Synchronization:** Ensuring the game state remains consistent for users, especially after interruptions like network disconnects or intentional pauses.
- **User Management:** Gracefully handling edge cases during student registration and enrollment, such as pre-existing accounts and invalid data formats.
- **Player Inactivity:** Creating a fair and robust system to manage inactive players in a multiplayer environment without disrupting the game for others.

## Technique Sessions

### Chaos Engineering Session

We deliberately tried to "break" the user flows by introducing chaotic events.

**1. Scenario: Network Disconnect During Order Placement**
   - **Chaos:** A student's internet connection drops right after they submit their weekly order.
   - **Identified Risk:** Potential for game state desynchronization, lost orders, and a corrupted game state.
   - **Solution:** Implement a "Resume" button. When the user reconnects, this button fetches the latest game state, informs the user of what happened while they were disconnected (e.g., AI turns), and allows them to continue from the correct point. This functionality also serves intentional pauses (e.g., for classroom play).

**2. Scenario: Malicious or Invalid Data Entry**
   - **Chaos:** A user enters non-sensical data into configuration fields (e.g., text in a number field, negative game duration).
   - **Identified Risk:** Potential for application errors, crashes, or security vulnerabilities (injection attacks).
   - **Solution:** Implement a multi-layered defense:
     - **Input Restriction:** Frontend fields should restrict input types (e.g., numbers only).
     - **Server-Side Validation:** The backend must validate all inputs for type, range, and format.
     - **Sanitization:** All text inputs must be sanitized to prevent XSS and SQL injection attacks.
     - **Length Limits:** Enforce character/word limits on text fields.

**3. Scenario: Faulty CSV Upload for Student Enrollment**
   - **Chaos:** A teacher uploads a CSV file with missing columns, incorrect email formats, or duplicate entries.
   - **Identified Risk:** Could lead to partial data import, application errors, or frustrated users.
   - **Solution:** Implement robust server-side CSV validation. The system will reject any invalid file and provide a specific error report to the teacher (e.g., "Row 5 has an invalid email").

### Role Playing Session

We explored user behavior by adopting different personas.

**1. Persona: The "Distracted" / "AFK" (Away From Keyboard) Player**
   - **Scenario:** In a multiplayer game, one student is inattentive or leaves the game entirely.
   - **Identified Risk:** The game stalls for all other players, ruining the experience. The initial proposal to have an AI take over after 2 minutes was good but could be refined.
   - **Refined Solution:** A multi-step process for handling inactivity:
     - **Visible Turn Timer:** A 120-second timer is visible to all players each turn.
     - **Warning:** At 30 seconds remaining, a clear notification is triggered.
     - **Temporary AI Takeover:** If the timer expires, a conservative AI makes a single move for the inactive player to keep the game flowing.
     - **Vote-to-Replace:** If a player is inactive for 3 consecutive turns, the other players are given the option to vote to replace them with a permanent AI for the remainder of the game.

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities

_Ideas ready to implement now_

- Implement strict server-side validation and sanitization for all user input fields.
- Develop the "Resume" functionality to handle game state synchronization after interruptions.
- Build the refined multi-step system for managing AFK players in multiplayer games.
- Create the robust CSV validation logic for the teacher's student import feature.
