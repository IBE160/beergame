# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-10-27
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** BIP

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Root Cause Analysis and Solution Design for Player Inactivity

**Session Goals:** To deeply analyze the problem of AFK (Away From Keyboard) players in a multiplayer context using the "5 Whys" technique, and then to systematically enhance the previously brainstormed solution using the SCAMPER method to create a robust, flexible, and user-friendly system.

**Techniques Used:** 
- 5 Whys
- SCAMPER (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse)

**Total Ideas Generated:** 5

### Key Themes Identified:

- **Context-Aware Design:** The solution must adapt to different environments, specifically distinguishing between a standard online game and a structured classroom session.
- **Player Agency:** Empowering active players with tools to manage the situation (like the "Nudge" and "Pause & Save" features) creates a better user experience.
- **Streamlined Rules:** Simplifying processes (like eliminating the voting step) leads to clearer, more decisive, and fair outcomes.
- **Proactive vs. Reactive Systems:** The best solutions not only react to problems (inactivity) but also provide proactive tools for players to manage the game state collaboratively (consensual pause).

## Technique Sessions

### 1. "5 Whys" Root Cause Analysis

We started by drilling down into the core problem of player inactivity.

- **Problem:** A player goes AFK, stalling the game for everyone else.
- **Why #1 (is that a problem?):** Because the other players cannot proceed and are stuck waiting.
- **Why #2 (can't they proceed?):** Because the game rules mandate that every player must place their order before the next round can begin.
- **Why #3 (is that mandated?):** Because this is a core rule of the game that must be followed.
- **Why #4 (is that rule essential?):** Because it reflects a synchronized step in time for the entire supply chain. If one part of the chain stops, the whole system halts.
- **Why #5 (is it critical the flow never stops?):** Because the game has a set number of rounds. To achieve the learning objectives, the game **must be completed** by playing all the rounds.

**Root Cause Identified:** The game must be completed to be effective, and a single inactive player breaks the synchronous flow required to finish all the rounds.

### 2. SCAMPER Solution Enhancement

We used the SCAMPER method to systematically improve the initial idea (timer -> temp AI -> vote-to-replace).

- **Substitute:** We substituted the automated AI takeover in a classroom setting with **manual teacher intervention**. The teacher gets a notification and can use a dashboard to resolve the issue, providing human oversight.
- **Combine:** We combined the AFK system with a communication feature. Players can now send a pre-defined, non-customizable **"Nudge" or "Ping"** to the inactive player, encouraging them to act before the system takes over.
- **Adapt:** No new ideas were generated from this step.
- **Modify:** We confirmed that making the timers **configurable** is a key modification, allowing teachers to adjust the game's difficulty and pace.
- **Eliminate:** We **eliminated the "vote-to-replace" step** in favor of a stricter, more streamlined rule. In a standard game, the player is automatically replaced by an AI. In a classroom game, the teacher is notified. This removes ambiguity.
- **Reverse:** We reversed the concept from a reactive punishment to a proactive feature. Players can now **initiate a "Pause & Save" request**, which allows all players to unanimously agree to stop the game and resume it later.

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities

_Ideas ready to implement now_

The fully refined, multi-part solution for handling player inactivity and game pauses is ready for technical specification and implementation. The complete system includes:
1.  A short, visible turn timer with a conservative AI making a single move if it expires.
2.  A "Nudge" feature for players to ping an inactive user.
3.  Two distinct modes for handling extended inactivity:
    - **Standard Mode:** Automatic, permanent AI replacement after a configurable timer expires.
    - **Classroom Mode:** Notification sent to a teacher dashboard for manual intervention.
4.  A teacher override/dashboard system for classroom sessions.
5.  A consensual "Pause & Save" feature, allowing players to unanimously agree to stop and resume the game later.
